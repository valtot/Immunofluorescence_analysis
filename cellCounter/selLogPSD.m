function sPsImage = selLogPSD(I,psImage,sigma,thr)
% selects spots by quality
%
% inputs
% ------
% I: image
% psImage: point source image mask, obtained with logPSD
% sigma: std dev of gaussian that best fits spots
% thr: correlation threshold; spot is selected if correlation with ideal spot is above this; should be in range [-1,1]
%
% output
% ------
% point source image mask (false everywhere except at location of selected spots)
